Todo:
- [x] Create the Breaker Block indicator
[Maybe other indicators will be useful]
- [x] Create every indicator output as classes
- [x] Create a possibility to return non-visual (numeric) data
- [x] Add tests for this
- [x] Create a possibility to enable/disable indicators
- [x] Connect the bot to database (probably local), to store the user_ids and their preferences
- [x] Possibility to calculate indicators only on demand
- [x] Add tests for this
- [ ] Create a logic to find predictable movements, based on the created indicators
- [ ] Add another tests for this
- [ ] Find the most appropriate time interval for predictions
- [ ] Consider about the timing of checking the market
- [ ] Consider about a logic of pinging users about predictable movements
- [ ] Add tests for this
- [ ] Create a neural network and make it learn on own data
- [ ] Integrate a neural network to the predictions system
