- Create a logic to find predictable movements, based on the created indicators
- Add another tests for this
- Find the most appropriate time interval for predictions
- Consider about the timing of checking the market
- Consider about a logic of pinging users about predictable movements
- Add tests for this
- Create a neural network and make it learn on own data
- Integrate a neural network to the predictions system
